// Package fileview turns the bytes of a file attached to a Mattermost post into
// something a model can use inside a client that has nothing else: no file
// system, no shell, no program to open it with. What it can use is text or an
// image, so a file becomes one of those, converted here, or a description of
// what it is.
//
// Text comes back as numbered lines in windows, so a long file is read a part
// at a time and one enormous line cannot flood a context. What the file is
// decides everything else, and is read from its bytes; the extension is only a
// hint where the bytes cannot tell.
//
// Nothing here makes a request. The caller fetches the file and hands over its
// bytes, so the conversion is tested on bytes alone, and reaching Mattermost
// stays the business of the code that already does.
