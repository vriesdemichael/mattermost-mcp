# ADR-003: AI agents as first-class developers

Agents are first-class contributors here, and everything a contributor needs to know is written down where an agent finds it: AGENTS.md for the mechanics and pitfalls of working in this repository, CONTRIBUTING.md for the process, the decision records for the rules and why they hold, the docs for how mm-mcp behaves, and a focused comment beside code whose reason the code does not show. Nothing depends on tribal knowledge or on a convention inferred from the code. When you find a recurring convention that is written nowhere, propose a record or an AGENTS.md entry for it. AGENTS.md repeats the rules from CONTRIBUTING.md that an agent must not lose, because an agent keeps AGENTS.md in context through compaction and drops a file it read once; change such a rule in both.

A decision record states a rule as it holds now, in prose: the rule first, then why it holds, with what a contributor or an agent must do in the same prose, and the alternatives turned down under Not chosen. CONTRIBUTING.md, under Writing a decision record, has the shape. Keep it short: an agent carries what it reads in its context, where a sentence with no rule, reason or instruction in it is noise. An agent reads a record as authoritative and cannot tell a stale one from a live one, so a record that stops holding is changed or deleted, never left standing.

An agent needs the same context a person does, and a session keeps none of it. Standards written down explicitly keep the next session, and the next contributor, consistent with the last.

## Not chosen

- **Conventions in code comments alone**: Comments are scattered, and rarely capture a rule that spans the repository.
- **Let agents infer conventions from the code**: Slower, inconsistent, and it copies whatever the code got wrong.
